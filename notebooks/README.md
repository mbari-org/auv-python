The Notebooks in this directory are intended to be used to examine the data
generated by each of the steps described in the [workflow]("../DORADO_WORKFLOW.md"):

    logs2netcdfs.py → calibrate.py → align.py → resample.py → archive.py → <ML operations & analysis>
                   1.x            2.x        3.x           4.x          5.x          6.x

They are named in the order of processing and kept specific to their purpose:

    1.0-mpm-logs2netcdfs.ipynb
    1.1-mpm-logs2netcdfs-ssds.ipynb
    2.0-mpm-calibrate.ipynb
    3.0-mpm-align.ipynb
    4.0-mpm-resample.ipynb
    4.1-mpm-resample-matlab.ipynb

The begining of analysis operations performed on the processed data:

    5.0-mpm-stoqs2parquet.ipynb
    5.1-mpm-biolume_raw-plotting.ipynb
    5.2-mpm-gb_biolume-PiO-paper.ipynb
    5.3-mpm-compare_auv_biolume.ipynb
    5.4-mpm-gulper_measurements.ipynb

Experiments with visualization:

    5.5-mpm-explore_relationships.ipynb
    5.7-mpm-explore_relationships_september2013.ipynb
    5.8-mpm-holoviews_and_ipywidget_demonstration.ipynb  # CSUMB Capstone project
    5.9-mpm-holoviews_interactive_hs2_viz.ipynb

Analysis and visulization Notebooks in support of the Plankton Proxies project:

    6.0-mpm-compare_auv_hs2_ecopuck.ipynb
    6.1-mpm-cross-calibrate-dorado-pontus-backscatter.ipynb


The bokeh/holoviews plots have a lot of data in the output cells, so you may want to
clear them before committing changes to the notebooks. The following command will
remove all output cells from the notebooks:

    find . -name "*.ipynb" -exec jupyter nbconvert --ClearOutputPreprocessor.enabled=True --inplace {} \;

Note that some notebooks are purposely committed with the first few cells rendered so 
that it's easier to understand the notebook's purpose.
